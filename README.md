### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Benoit, a passionate software engineer. During my working hours, I mainly focus on building and maintaing data pipelines :wrench:. I also put ML models in production and monitor the good behaviour of our applications once in production.

Outside of my working hours, I enjoy learning new technologies that are far from my day-to-day life. For example, I'm learning Rust and I have previously worked on side projects about cybersecurity or Front-end development. As an open-source enthusiast, my aim is to contribute more to open-source projects this year and keep sharing my work as much as possible :blush:.

## :pencil2: Blogging and writing

:computer: I love sharing my knowledge with the community. You can find me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@benoit.goujon) or on [my blog](https://benoitgoujon.com/). Publishing on dev.to is on my to-do list!

:orange_book: I'm also starting to write my own book on how to learn rust with tests. I'm particularly excited about this project. The book is [available online](https://b-a-goujon.gitbook.io/learn-rust-with-tests/) for free.
